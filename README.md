# LearningDjango
This repo contains code for some of the apps that I built while learning the Django framework. The project is hosted on a Digital Ocean droplet. Visit [learningdjango.in](learningdjango.in) to see it live.


### Django Apps
1. Polls
2. Blog

### Technology
```
Back-end - Python 2.7  
Web Framework - Django 1.9  
Database - sqlite3  
Front-end tool - Bootstrap  
Operating System - Ubuntu 16.04  
```

### Installation
I have moved the secret key and database settings to a different file as it's deployed on a remote server. So it's not possible to run the project locally. 

Also I am planning to write some articles related to this project on my blog [chinmayapatanaik.com](chinmayapatanaik.com). So stay tuned.
