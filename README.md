# LearningDjango
This repo contains code for some of the apps that I built while learning the Django framework. In future I am planning to deploy this project on a DigitalOcean droplet. 

### Django Apps
1. Polls

### Technology
```
Back-end - Python 2.7  
Web Framework - Django 1.9  
Database - sqlite3  
Front-end tool - Bootstrap  
Operating System - Ubuntu 16.04  
```

### Installation
I have moved the secret key and database settings to a different file as it will be deployed on a remote server. So it's not possible to run the project locally. 

Also I am planning to write articles on my blog [chinmayapatanaik.com](chinmayapatanaik.com). So stay tuned.
